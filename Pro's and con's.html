<h1 style="text-align: center;color: #cccffc;">Some Interesting Facts About Rainforests </h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center;color:    white;">The good stuff â˜º</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>1. Rainforests Cover Less Than 2% of the Earthâ€™s Surface.</h3>
    <li>Rainforests are home to half of the worldâ€™s species.</li>
    <li>There are seven temperate rainforests, and the Pacific one is the biggest</li>
    <li>Around 30 million species of plants and animals live in tropical rainforests.</li>
    <li>25% of modern medicines originate from tropical plants.</li>
    <li>In South-East Asia, alternative medicine uses around 6,500 tropical plant varieties to treat illnesses, including malaria and syphilis.</li><br>
    <p>Among the rich rainforest vegetation, only 1% of plants are in use. The other 99% are yet to be discovered or have no use in medicine so far. We should thank rainforests for providing some of the best cancer medicines. Also, natural remedies like organic CBD oil for dogs and humans or therapeutic essential oils are derived from plants grown in the rainforests.</p>

    <h3>2. The Livelihood of 1,6 Billion People Depends on the Rainforest.</h3>
    <li>400 tribes, with one million Indians, live in the Amazon forests.</li>
    <li>The most famous tribal people, called Pygmies, live in the Congo rainforest.</li>
    <li>22 ecosystems, 270 plant species, and 6 forest types have been identified in the Bosawas Biosphere Reserve.</li>
    <li>Rainforests are home to more than half of the planetâ€™s terrestrial species</li>
    <p>Rainforest inhabitants have a very different life than ours. Living in these areas without basic survival instincts is impossible, and many people get lost there without ever returning.</p>

    <h3>3. Rainfall Levels in Rainforests Are Around 2,000 mm per Year.</h3>
    <li>The annual average rainforest temperature is 82,4 Â°F.</li>
    <li>Rainforests absorb 250 billion tons of CO2, equal to 90 times the man-made greenhouse gas emission per year.</li>
    <li>The Amazon rainforest has the hottest temperatures of 91 Â°F during the day and 71Â°F at night.</li>
    <p>The facts about the rainforest climate are telling that there is no typical four-season weather out there. For example, there are only dry and wet seasons in tropical forests, with an average temperature of 77 Â°F. </p>

    <h3>4. Due to the Tropical Rainforestsâ€™ High Temperatures, the Average Air Humidity Falls Between 77% and 88%.</h3>
    <li>Because of their warmth and moisture, tropical rainforests produce 75% of the rain through transpiration and evaporation.One of the tropical rainforest characteristics is the diverse terrestrial ecosystems. There are over 100 species of rainforest trees found in each hectare.</li>
    <li>One of the tropical rainforest characteristics is the diverse terrestrial ecosystems. There are over 100 species of rainforest trees found in each hectare.</li>
    <li>The tropical forests of Sumatra and Borneo are home to the Sumatran rhinoceros, which is one of the five extinct rhino species.</li>
    <p>These unique facts about the tropical rainforests show that it has the most diverse ecosystem globally. </p>

    <h3>5. The Top Rainforest Layer Is the Emergent Layer.</h3>
     <li>The bottom tropical rainforest layer, or the forest floor, receives only 2% of the sunlight.</li>
     <li>Most trees in the emergent layer are 200 feet high.</li>
     <li>The Amazon rainforestâ€™s canopy layer, with its jungle-like density, contributes to 75% of all photosynthesis on the planet.</li>
     <li>The rainforestâ€™s understorey layer can be thousands of meters away from the canopy layer</li> 
     <p>The rainforest provides shelter and food for animals and plants. Logically, the tallest trees form the emergent layer, and they get the most sunlight and rain. In contrast, the forest floor receives a small amount of sunlight and humidity.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;color:white;">The bad stuff ðŸ˜¥</h2>
<h3>1. weather</h3>
<p>The weather in the tropical rainforest is always hot and humid. Itâ€™s also not rare to see rain every day or at least on most days. It can rain more than 100 inches a year. Because the rainforest is so humid, steam raising from the ground is not uncommon, especially on those days when itâ€™s not raining. The area is always wet, always humid. Temperatures can easily rise to the mid-90s (Fahrenheit), but because of the humidity, it feels much higher. This would make life there very uncomfortable. So much rain also makes it difficult to grow most crops, as they would rot.</p>
<h3>2. Tropical Diseases</h3>
<p>Tropical diseases thrive in the rainforest area because of the hot, humid climate. Many are difficult to treat and many are deadly if not caught early. Malaria, a common disease found in tropical rainforests, can be treated but thereâ€™s no vaccine for prevention. Other common tropical diseases include dengue, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis and African trypanosomiasis. Some of these are bacterial disease, some are parasites. If you were living in the tropical rainforest, your chances of contracting a tropical disease at some point are high.</p>
<h3>3. Poverty</h3>
<p>The populated areas surrounding tropical rainforests tend to be poor. According to the University of Connecticut, the poorest people in Brazil live in the rainforest area. Areas surrounding tropical rainforests are also mostly local. This means few hospitals, schools and other comforts of modern life. When these are available, they are usually of lower quality than those you would find in more urban areas.</p>
<h3>4. Isolation</h3>
<p>Areas near tropical rainforests are scarcely populated or rural; if you need or want something from town, youâ€™ll have to travel to get it. Distances could be long and you might lack basic comforts, such as electricity, Internet connection or potable water.</p>
